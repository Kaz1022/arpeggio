Arpeggio
=========
Arpeggio is a simple web app where a user can post a music session, and others see the available spots and apply to attend the session. It is built with React for front-end, Ruby on Rails for back-end, PostgreSQL for database and Twilio API. 

This is our final group project at LighthouseLabs and we are proud that we accomplished creating a web app with Rails which was relatively new to us.

### Users can ...
- register, log-in and logout with their account 
- browse and filter events 
- favorite items to check up on them later or unlike them
- reserve a spot by clicking an icon which sends a text to the organizer of the event
- create sessions which can be seen by others
- accept the applicant by clicking the icon
- cancel the applicant and make the spot available again
